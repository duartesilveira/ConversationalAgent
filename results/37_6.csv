Human errors are not a source of experimental error; rather, they are experimenter's error.Do not quote human error as a source of experimental error.ystematic error is an error inherent in the experimental set up which causes the results to be skewed in the same direction every time, i.e., always too large or always too small.

Before we can talk about probabilities of various sums, say 3 or 7, we have to understand what outcomes are possible in this experiment. If we roll two dice, each die could show 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So the sum of the two faces could be any whole number from 2 to 12. We call this set of possible outcomes in the random experiment the sample space . Here the sample space can be written as. Sample space = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12} Let's consider the set of all possible outcomes for other basic random experiments. Suppose we plan to toss a coin 3 times and the outcome of interest is the number of heads."

Titration is one type of analytical procedure often used in standardization. In a titration, an exact volume of one substance is reacted with a known amount of another substance.The point at which the reaction is complete in a titration is referred to as the endpoint. A chemical substance known as an indicator is used to indicate (signal) the endpoint.The indicator used in this experiment is phenolphthalein. Phenolphthalein, an organic compound, is colorless in acidic solution and pink in basic solution. This experiment involves two separate acid-base standardization procedures.In the first standardization the molarity of a sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) will be determined by titrating a sample of potassium acid phthalate (KHP; HKC8H4O4) with the NaOH.his experiment involves two separate acid-base standardization procedures.
