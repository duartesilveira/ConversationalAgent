Every increase of 3 dB is a doubling of the sound pressure level (twice as many micropascals). A sound of 23 dB is twice as much energy as a sound of 20 dB. 2.

Conversational speech is at about 60-70 dB; a whisper is around 20 dB. 4. The decibel scale is actually a pretty accurate representation of how the human auditory system perceives sound.

I used the term raw gain to let the reader know this is actual signal gain produced by the antenna not the antenna with amplifier. Unfortunately there are no laws (none that anyone enforces) to prevent false dB antenna gain ratings. If I state 5 dB someone else can state 6. I think you know what I mean. I came across a small antenna claiming it produced over 30 dB gain. I know this antenna isn't producing that kind of performance. In fact it's more likely only around 3 dB or less. I state an average raw antenna gain of 5.8 dB on the EZ HD antenna. The test method is dBd (gain over a dipole). A 5.8 dBd gain is excellent for an antenna of this size.

As we move away from the source of a sound, the pressure drops approximately in proportion to the distance. As the distance from the sound source doubles in length, the sound pressure level is reduced by half. The height and depth of sound waves is referred to as amplitude or loudness. As the amplitude increases, the volume increases. Our ears can detect sound over a very wide range of amplitudes, which are often measured and described in terms of decibels (dB).
