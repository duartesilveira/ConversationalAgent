I do agree, however, that this song is about as close to mainstream as you can get with this band, next to Swing Life Away. The beauty of Rise Against is that they pull it off like no other punk band can.What is truly execellent about their music, besides the gripping vocals and powerful sound, are the lyrics of the songs. Rise Against doesn't just sing about girlfriends and heartache and the self-pity or angst and suicide and rage.These lyrics have meaning. That's a rare thing to find in music these days. repeat: These lyrics have meaning! Paper Wings talks about the uncertainty of people, and how you can only truly count on yourself. You have to lead the life that's right for you, and sometimes that means leaving behind the people you wish you could take with you."

In music, the word hook refers to that part of a song that catches the ear of the listener. In other words, it's a lyrical line or melodic phrase that makes the song memorable. In this context you can say songwriting is somewhat like fishing; make your hook strong and appealing and you'll be able to catch 'em and reel 'em in. The hook may be the title of the song, a lyrical line (usually repeated) that summarizes what the song is about, a rhythmic passage or an instrumental part called riff. It is mostly evident in pop music; songs that have made it to the top of the charts have unforgettable hooks."
