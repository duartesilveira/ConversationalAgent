Anemia is characterized by a reduction in the number of circulating red blood cells (RBCs), the amount of hemoglobin, or the volume of packed red blood cells (hematocrit).Anemia is classified as acute or chronic. Acute anemia denotes a precipitous drop in the RBC population due to hemolysis or acute hemorrhage.t is generally accepted that an acute drop in hemoglobin to a level of 7-8 g/dL is symptomatic, whereas levels of 4-5 g/dL may be tolerated in chronic anemia, as the body is able to gradually replace the loss of intravascular volume."

The total amount of iron bound to transferrin is referred to as total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). TIBC will help your doctor differentiate between different types of anemia. TIBC is high in iron deficiency anemia and low/normal with anemia of chronic disease. TIBC is also used to help doctors diagnose iron overload, which is called hemochromatosis. Low levels of iron are associated with iron deficiency anemia."

In hemolytic anemia, red blood cells in the blood are destroyed earlier than normal.emolytic anemia occurs when the bone marrow is unable to replace the red blood cells that are being destroyed.
