It is also caused by blood loss, such as from heavy menstrual bleeding, an ulcer, cancer and regular use of some over-the-counter pain relievers, especially aspirin. Vitamin deficiency anemia. In addition to iron, your body needs folate and vitamin B-12 to produce enough healthy red blood cells. A diet lacking in these and other key nutrients can cause decreased red blood cell production. Additionally, some people may consume enough B-12, but their bodies aren't able to process the vitamin. This can lead to vitamin deficiency anemia, also known as pernicious anemia.

There are several common blood tests that may be used to diagnose anemia. A red blood cell count can measure the number of red blood cells that you have. Hemoglobin can also be measured. These two tests are included in a complete blood count or CBC. A CBC can also tell the size of the red blood cells.
