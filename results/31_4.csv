Thatâs why itâs so important to understand lung cancer and how it affects your body. The Effects of Lung Cancer. Your lungs are part of a system of organs and tissues that allow you to breathe. They perform this role by taking air into your body and then moving waste gases back out. When you have lung cancer, abnormal (or âmalignantâ) cells form a cancerous tumor in your lungs. These cancer cells begin to damage and destroy your lung tissue. Malignant lung tumors may grow very quickly. The American Lung Association (ALA) notes that the uncontrollable growth of a tumor may block your airways, making it difficult to breathe. Whatâs more, sometimes cancerous tumors may spread from one part of your body to another. This happens when a tumor sheds malignant cells, which may then be transported to other parts of your body. The cell may be carried either through lymph fluid that surrounds your lung tissue or through your bloodstream. What Causes Lung Cancer?

825,msmarco,_doc,MARCO_8693800,4.870628,"Not all cancers spread, but any cancer can spread to any other part of the body. When it does take hold in an organ, it can grow in a disorderly fashion and interfere with the normal function of that organ. When cancer does spread, it more commonly metastasizes to vital organs such as the lungs, liver, bone, and brain. It may take months or even years for a microscopic metastasis to grow large enough to be seen on x-ray images or to cause symptoms. Also, some cancers that spread affect a particular organ or tissue more commonly than others. The cells of a metastatic tumor are derived from those originating in the primary tumor. For example, if colorectal cancer metastasizes to the liver, the tumor in the liver is made up of colorectal cancer cells, not liver cancer cells."

The signs and symptoms will depend on where the cancer is, how big it is, and how much it affects the organs or tissues. If a cancer has spread (metastasized), signs or symptoms may appear in different parts of the body. As a cancer grows, it can begin to push on nearby organs, blood vessels, and nerves. This pressure causes some of the signs and symptoms of cancer. If the cancer is in a critical area, such as certain parts of the brain, even the smallest tumor can cause symptoms. But sometimes cancer starts in places where it wonât cause any signs or symptoms until it has grown quite large."
