A Single-Nucleotide-Polymorphism (SNP) is a kind of genetic variation that you find in population. This genetic variation is defined as a variation caused by only one single nucleotide (as its name indicates it).For example if you have in the populations the two following variants at the same locus: AGCCGT and AGCTGT, then you have a SNP at the position of the C and T. This type of variation is very common. Single-Nucleotide-Polymorphism (SNP) is a kind of genetic variation that you find in population.

Gene alleles determine distinct traits that can be passed on from parents to offspring. Gene variation is important to the process of natural selection.The genetic variations that arise in a population happen by chance, but the process of natural selection does not. Natural selection is the result of the interactions between genetic variations in a population and the environment.The environment determines which variations are more favorable.enetic variation occurs mainly through DNA mutation, gene flow (movement of genes from one population to another) and sexual reproduction."
