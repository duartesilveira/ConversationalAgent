Other servicesâfrom YouTube to HBO Goâshould require a similar amount of bandwidth for their HD, 1080p streams. If youâre using Netflixâs 4K UHD stream, that requires 25 Mbps. Music streams require much less bandwidth than video streams. Take all this into account. If youâre using a Netflix HD stream, upgrading from 25 Mbps to 50 Mbps wonât really help youâNetflixâs bitrate is the bottleneck, not your internet speed.
