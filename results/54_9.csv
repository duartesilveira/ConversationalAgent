The ability of this device to change voltage is a major advantage of AC electricity over direct current (DC).C transformers. You can see that DC voltages could not be changed with the configuration of the transformer. This is because the DC current would not be changing the magnetic field the way AC current does. And this was the reason that AC won over DC when electricity started to be used around the world.

Also known as a narghile, shisha or goza, a hookah is a water pipe with a smoke chamber, a bowl, a pipe and a hose. Specially made tobacco is heated, and the smoke passes through water and is then drawn through a rubber hose to a mouthpiece. The tobacco is no less toxic in a hookah pipe than in a cigarette, and the water in the hookah does not filter out the toxic ingredients in the tobacco smoke. Hookah smokers may actually inhale more tobacco smoke than cigarette smokers do because of the large volume of smoke they inhale in one smoking session, which can last as long as 60 minutes."
