I used the term raw gain to let the reader know this is actual signal gain produced by the antenna not the antenna with amplifier. Unfortunately there are no laws (none that anyone enforces) to prevent false dB antenna gain ratings. If I state 5 dB someone else can state 6. I think you know what I mean. I came across a small antenna claiming it produced over 30 dB gain. I know this antenna isn't producing that kind of performance. In fact it's more likely only around 3 dB or less. I state an average raw antenna gain of 5.8 dB on the EZ HD antenna. The test method is dBd (gain over a dipole). A 5.8 dBd gain is excellent for an antenna of this size. I don't want to stir the pot but TV antennas in the past decade have become popular again and are big business for some. Many companies are offering low quality imported antennas.

Or maybe there is one - it is called dB gain or decibel gain. dB-gain is the most accurate way to measure the strength of a cell phone signal. dB Gain and your Cell Phone Signal Booster The best way to measure the cell phone signal strength is as decibels or dBgain because it is most accurate without flip flops at one time and place. A -50dB represents a really strong signal or full bars and a -110 dB represents a weak or dead signal or no bars.

A sound with POWER 100 times the reference would be 20 dB. The answer to your question is: It can be. Sound intensity (if expressed as a pressure) and Sound Pressure Level (SPL) are the same.

Fortunately Android provides a way to prevent any app from sucking data in the background, and there are third-party apps out there that can take things to the next level."

It can be measured directly in dB with a Spectrum Analyzer or Network Analyzer along with a few key components.SWR is defined as the ratio of the maximum voltage to the minimum voltage in the standing wave. The larger the impedance mismatch, the larger the amplitude of the standing wave. A perfect impedance match would cause no voltage standing wave, so the ratio of the maximum voltage to the minimum would be 1 (1:1)."
