Follow this quick guide for using ice or heat for sports injury: After an acute injury, such as an ankle sprain, or after activities that aggravate a chronic injury, such as shin splints. Use an ice bag with cubed ice, ice pack or ice massage. When using an ice pack that does not have real ice cubes, use a thin towel between the ice pack and the skin to prevent frostbite. Do not use ice longer than 20 minutes at a time. More time spent icing does not mean more relief."
