It is delivered to the tissues (w â¦ hich are composed of cells) when oxygen-containing red blood cells enter a capillary that passes through a tissue. The oxygen leaves the red blood cells and passes through the wall of the capillary where it can be taken up by the cells of the tissue. Blood type refers to particular proteins called antigens on the surface of these red blood cells. Some people's red blood cells have the A antigen on their surface; these people have type A blood. Some people have the B antigen and are type B. Some have both (AB) and some have neither (type O). Any given person will only have one blood type (you only have type O or type A blood) and all of the red blood cells in that person are the same type. No one of these blood types is any better or worse than transporting oxygen.

Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen to your body's organs and tissues and transports carbon dioxide from your organs and tissues back to your lungs.If a hemoglobin test reveals that your hemoglobin level is lower than normal, it means you have a low red blood cell count (anemia).Anemia can have many different causes, including vitamin deficiencies, bleeding and chronic diseases.emoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen to your body's organs and tissues and transports carbon dioxide from your organs and tissues back to your lungs.

They can also be counted by use of a microscope.Normal platelet counts are in the range of 150,000 to 400,000 per microliter (or 150 - 400 x 10 9 per liter).
