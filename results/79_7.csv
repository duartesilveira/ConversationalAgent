The purpose of this article is to expose a gap in the current academic discussion of visual art criticism: the lack of serious attention to the role of ethical judgment.

Criticism is now often understood as a practice that is either coextensive with art practice or is a benevolent commentary on art works. Many of the above reasons for judgmentâs displacement from art criticism were identified in a roundtable discussion published in October in 2002.
