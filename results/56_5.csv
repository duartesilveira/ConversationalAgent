It's no surprise that Darwin knew about these cellular components, because they were visible to microscopes of that time.f course, neither Darwin nor Lewes is to be faulted for getting these things wrong. It's obvious that in their time knowledge of molecular biology and cell structure was extremely primitive compared to 2013.
