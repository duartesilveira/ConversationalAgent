The Bengal tiger, or Royal Bengal tiger, roams a wide range of habitats including high altitudes, tropical and subtropical rainforests, mangroves, and grasslands. They are primarily found in parts of India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Male Bengal tigers measure 8 to 10 ft (2 to 3m) in length, and can weigh from 440-650 lb (200-300kg). Female Bengal tigers measure from around 8 to almost 9 ft (2.5 to 2.6 m) and weigh in around 220 to 400 lb (100 to 181 kg). All white tigers are a variation in color of the Bengal tiger, some tigers have been reported that are white with or without black stripes. Bengal tigers hunt medium and large-sized animals, such as wild boar, badgers, water buffaloes, deer goats and have been know to prey on small elephants and rhino calves."

But the size of a modern female blue whale is over 30 mtrs (115 feet) which makes so far as we know the largest animal that has ever existed. (Until we find fossils of something bigger).So the Megalodon was probably bigger than some smaller whales but not the Blue whale. Also since sharks don't have a bony skeleton this size is an estimation based on the assumption that the size to tooth ratio is the same of present large sharks but this could be in error.hich shark is larger megalodon shark or whale shark? megalodon shark was much bigger than whale shark cause a megalodon shark is almost 100 feet while an whale shark is just 62-75 feet.
