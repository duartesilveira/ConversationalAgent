The Maya wrote their numbers from top to bottom rather than from left to right, but apart from that, their system was not so different from ours. For example, to write the number 34, we place a three in the tens column and a four in the ones column. The Maya put a one in the twenties column and a fourteen in the ones column. Adding and subtracting in the Maya system is simply a matter of juggling the dots and bars. To calculate 36 + 13, for example, you start by adding the units (i.e., 16 + 13). This gives you 29, so you leave 9 in the ones column and carry the 20 up, giving you a grand total of 2 twenties and 9 ones = 49."

Each one has a unique R group with properties that elicit the properties of the protein; for example, lysine is basic due to its hydroxyl group. Amino acids are linked through peptide linkages between amino and carboxyl groups of different amino acids. The amino group loses an H while the carboxyl group loses an OH, and the result is a water molecule and two linked amino acids. This is called a dehydration reaction or dehydration synthesis and is typical of the polymerization of several biomacromolecules."
