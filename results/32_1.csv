It isnât uncommon for them to be thought of as large stingrays. But the simplest way to tell them apart is by looking at the location of the fins.

There are four basic groups of shark diets and because of this there are four basic types of shark teeth.-Sharks that typically eat fish have long, narrow, needle-like teeth ideal for gripping something as slippery and streamlined as a fish.-Sharks that are benthic feeders, eating bivalves and crustaceans, have thick, plate-like teeth perfect for crushing the shells of their prey. sharkâs teeth are arranged in rows, the number of which varies from species to species. The row nearest the front of the mouth is the âworkingâ row of teeth (though some sharks use up to the first 8 rows of teeth), and they are the largest teeth in a sharksâ mouth."

Caudal Fins When it comes to the shark having the ability to propel itself through the water, they utilize what is called the caudal fin. This fin, also known as the tail fin, has an upper and lower lobe that, depending on the type of shark, can vary in shape and size. The upper lobe of the caudal fin produces the majority of the sharkâs thrusting abilities. The tail fin is one of the most important parts of the entire shark anatomy. Types Of Shark Tail Fins Because of all of these different types of fins, sharks are able to maneuver swiftly through the water while also remaining stabilized."

Some species, like the bull shark, are even known to swim in salt, fresh and brackish waters. Most sharks are especially active in the evening and night when they hunt. Some sharks migrate over great distances to feed and breed. This can take them over entire ocean basins. While some shark species are solitary, others display social behavior at various levels."

A great white shark was captured near Kangaroo Island in Australia on 1 April 1987. This shark was estimated to be more than 6.9 m (23 ft) long by Peter Resiley, and has been designated as KANGA. Another great white shark was caught in Malta by Alfredo Cutajar on 16 April 1987."

For theses reasons surface swimming should be kept to a minimum, in shark waters. Research shows that bright colors attract sharks more than dark objects, so it is better for divers to wear dark colors. Blood in the water can attract sharks from long distances. They can sense blood in the water in concentrations as little as 4 parts per million."

997,msmarco,_doc,MARCO_8795153,4.336691,"Sharks do not normally hunt humans. When they do attack a human, it is usually a case of mistaken identity. Shark sometimes mistake humans for its natural prey, such as fish or a marine mammal or sea turtle, and most often will release the person after the first bite. The majority of shark bites are hit-and-run attacks by smaller species, such as blacktip and spinner sharks. They mistake thrashing arms or dangling feet as prey, dart in, bite, and let go when they realize it's not a fish."

Such sharks include the thresher, Java, kitefin, salmon, broadnose sevengill, bigeye sand tiger, narrowmouth catshark, great hammerhead, Argentine angel shark and megamouth, which was only first discovered in 1976.re sharks dangerous or endangered? The answer is both. On the danger side, most sharks are apex predators. This means they exist at the top of the oceanic food chain and possess few, or no, natural enemies."

Parasites identified from this shark include a tapeworm in the genus Monorygma, the fluke Otodistomum veliporum, and the nematode Mooleptus rabuka.he gestation period may be as long as three and a half years, the longest of any vertebrate. Litter sizes vary from two to fifteen, and there is no distinct breeding season. Frilled sharks are occasional bycatch in commercial fisheries, but have little economic value."
