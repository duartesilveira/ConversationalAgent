The Bronze age in Europe did not begin until about 2000 B.C. The Bronze Age was characterized by the first use of metal tools in human civilization. First copper, then bronze, and even later, iron, were utilized as materials for making tools and consumer goods. First, however, the thinkers and creators of this era had to discover smelting, which is the extraction of metal from an ore through the use of heat. Since copper was essentially a soft and malleable metal, they then had to discover the art of alloying two metals together to create a new and harder metal."
