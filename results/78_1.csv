The general premise of high-protein/low-carb diets is that by cutting carbs and increasing protein, you can lose weight faster. Weight loss in the first few days and weeks of a high-protein diet is sometimes faster than with a calorie-controlled diet, but the extra weight loss is primarily due to increased water loss. Studies have shown that after a year, weight loss results are approximately the same on a low-carb diet as they are on a calorie-controlled or low-fat diet. More importantly, high-protein, low-carb diets usually mean you eat much more fat â often more than the recommended daily intake, and often more saturated fat than is healthy."
