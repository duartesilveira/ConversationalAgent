The Shang's writing system was used throughout the empire and helped unify the empire. Shang Dynasty Achievements - Bronze. The Shang and the Zhou dynasties are often referred to as the Bronze Age of China. Bronze casting was perhaps the greatest technology of the Shang Dynasty. The people of this period took bronze craftsmanship to an amazing level. The Shang people used bronze to make objects ranging from jewelry to weapons. Numerous beautiful works of art made with bronze during the Shang Dynasty have been discovered. Bronze objects were created by sculpting an object and then making a mold of it. Molten bronze was then poured into the mold. When the bronze hardened the mold was broken and the bronze piece was removed.
