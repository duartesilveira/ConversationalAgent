For example, Sognefjord â a fjord in Norway â plunges over 4,000 feet below sea level. As glaciers formed fjords, they would often leave deposits behind that would create a rise at the mouth of the fjord.This rise can cause some fjords to have very strong currents or even saltwater rapids. Another dangerous feature found near some fjords is the presence of thousands of small, rocky island blocks.These areas are called skerries and they can be treacherous for ships to navigate. Because they were formed by glaciers, fjords tend to be located in mountainous areas close to large bodies of water.For example, Norway is famous for its fjords.

A sea breeze or onshore breeze is any wind that blows from a large body of water toward or onto a landmass; it develops due to differences in air pressure created by the differing heat capacities of water and dry land. As such, sea breezes are more localised than prevailing winds. Because land absorbs solar radiation far more quickly than water, a sea breeze is a common occurrence along coasts after sunrise. By contrast, a land breeze or offshore breeze is the reverse effect: dry land also cools more quickly than water and, after sunset, a sea breeze dissipates and the wind instead flows from the land towards the sea.

Ingestion of cooked meat also causes a rise in blood creatinine levels; this is because the creatine in raw meat is converted to creatinine during the cooking process.
