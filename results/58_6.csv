There's different types of cloud, some of them are at very high levels and these are the ones that appear light and wispy. Typical cloud types are cirrus and cirrostratus and they're found at elevations of 6,000 metres upwards.Because they're so high up the air is very cold so they're usually formed of ice crystals.Mid level clouds form between 2,000 and 6,000 metres and these are the light fluffy ones. They can be either water or ice depending on the air temperature. Typical cloud types are altocumulus, altostratus.t levels below 2,000 metres the clouds are the ones that appear grey in the sky-often the sort associated with an overcast day and quite likely to contain water which falls as rain.

Where stable moist air flows over a mountain or a range of mountains, a series of large-scale standing waves may form on the downwind side. Lenticular clouds sometimes form at the crests of these waves. Under certain conditions, long strings of lenticular clouds can form, creating a formation known as a wave cloud. Power pilots tend to avoid flying near lenticular clouds because of the turbulence of the rotor systems that accompany them, but sailplane pilots actively seek them out."

Once you know the cloud heights in MSL, you can determine where you should fly, since altimeters are set in feet above MSL, not in feet AGL. Example: At Grand Forks International Airport (KGFK), clouds are reported broken at 7,000 feet AGL. Add the reported clouds of 7,000 feet AGL to the field elevation of 845 feet MSL to get a cloud base altitude of 7,845 feet MSL.

Another influence on the type of precipitation that forms is whether there are strong upward drafts of air inside the cloud. Rain is a water droplet in liquid form, usually in lower altitude clouds.Snow falls when clouds are in higher and colder altitudes, which causes the water vapor to freeze as it condenses to form ice crystals instead of water droplets that form the cloud.Sleet is rain that freezes as it is falling in cold temperatures.hese are high-altitude clouds made the same way that all clouds form, but the water droplets are frozen to form millions of tiny ice crystals.

Another influence on the type of precipitation that forms is whether there are strong upward drafts of air inside the cloud. Rain is a water droplet in liquid form, usually in lower altitude clouds. Snow falls when clouds are in higher and colder altitudes, which causes the water vapor to freeze as it condenses to form ice crystals instead of water droplets that form the cloud. Sleet is rain that freezes as it is falling in cold temperatures."

Clouds are formed when evaporation pulls water into the air creating the gaseous form of water called water vapor. When the air becomes saturated, water vapor condenses into liquid water droplets.

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) You could buy milk from the grocery shop, add the ingredients, put it in the ice cream maker and after few hours the ice cream would be ready! Here, you bought the basic ingredient (milk) from the store and processed it. Similarly, if you want to host a email service for your company, you could buy âcomputing powerâ from a cloud vendor, then install databases and applications to run your email service. So you are buying the basic infrastructure as a service from a cloud vendor. You get the basic infrastructure from the cloud vendor, and itâs up to you to decide what to do with it.
