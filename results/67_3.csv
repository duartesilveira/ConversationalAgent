994,msmarco,_doc,MARCO_7066796,4.6894646,A complete blood count (CBC) is a blood test that measures the number and quality of red blood cells red blood cellsA type of blood cell that carries oxygen to and carbon dioxide from tissues in the body. CBC includes the following information: 1  RBC count â the total number of RBCs. 2  WBC count â the total number of WBCs. 3  hemoglobin hemoglobinA protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen and gives blood its red colour.

If all this hemoglobin was in the plasma rather than inside the cells, blood would be so thick that the heart would have a difficult time pumping it through. The thickness of blood is called viscosity.The greater the viscosity of blood, the more friction there is and more pressure is needed to force blood through the heart and vessels.Since hemoglobin is a respiratory pigment the efficiency of oxygen transport is high in this closed and packaged model of the red blood cell.he thickness of blood is called viscosity.

They are used to help diagnose the cause of anemia, a condition in which there are too few red blood cells. The indices include: 1  Average red blood cell size (MCV)  Hemoglobin amount per red blood cell (MCH)"

Stem cells that turn into blood cells are called hematopoietic (heh-mat-uh-poy-EH-tik) stem cells. These cells are capable of developing into the three types of blood cells: 1  red blood cells that carry oxygen. 2  white blood cells that fight infection. 3  platelets that help blood to clot."
999,msmarco,_doc,MARCO_6325330,4.686448,Yellow marrow has a much higher amount of fat cells than red marrow. Both types of marrow contain blood vessels. Stem Cells The bone marrow works like a âfactoryâ that produces all of the cells that are found in the bone marrow and in the peripheral blood stream.This factory is dependent on the function of the pluripotent stem cells.he bone marrow normally produces mature red blood cells and the hemoglobin in these cells carry oxygen to the tissues in your body. The percentage of red blood cells in the total blood volume is called the hematocrit.
