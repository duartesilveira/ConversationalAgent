This time, I was intent on getting high, and being out of my usual stash of random mind-bending friends, I jumped on that Lyrica. I took a total of 600 mg. I would not recommend this to the first timers of Lyrica as some people have adverse reactions to the drug."

As predicted, when injected into mice, the heat-killed bacteria did not produce an infection. Griffith co-injected the heat-killed S with live R into mice, and, much to his surprise, the mice developed pneumonia and died. Even more astonishing, Griffith was able to isolate live S strain from the blood of infected mice."
