In the $5,000 to $9,000 range you can pick up a typical two- or three-seater jet ski with 110 to 150 horsepower which will propel you to speeds around 50 mph. At this price there wonât be many bells and whistles on these models. But if your budget permits you to spend more ($9,000 to $12,000), the overall build quality of the jet ski improves. Jet skis in this price range provide a smoother ride, offer an average of 200 horsepower and cruising speeds at 60 mph. At the $12,000 to $15,000 price point are jet skis that offer the fastest and most brutal ride out there."
875,msmarco,_doc,MARCO_1094033,4.591754,"Generally, super lightweight jets have a range of around 1,500 miles, depending on just how light they actually are. Naturally, the larger the jets are, the farther they can fly without touching down and that's because the fuel tanks get larger along with the overall size. Range increases as jet size increases, until you hit the largest jets which have ranges of around 4,000 miles. Of course, this is strictly private jet sizes. Once you get into commercial aircraft sizes, numbers change again. Flexjet's lightweight Learjet 40XR has a range of 1,750 miles and hits a speed of 515 miles per hour, while their large Challenger 604 and 605 have a range of 4,135 miles and a speed of 528 miles per hour."

This is because you need a driver, a second person to be a spotter/flag holder and room (a seat) to recover the skier. To pull a 150-200 pound skier, you should ideally have an 110 horsepower or greater jet ski. If youâve decided to water ski behind your jet ski, be sure to use a 100 foot tow rope.
