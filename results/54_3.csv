705,msmarco,_doc,MARCO_8197567,4.35896,"Iâll begin with an incorrect explanation for why air (or any other gas, for that matter) expands when you heat it. The reason Iâm doing this is that the following wrong explanation can be found in many science resources. Hot air molecules, on average, have more space between them than cool air molecules. Therefore, when you heat air it expands to allow more space for the molecules. If you then cool the air, it contracts because cool air molecules need less space than hot air molecules. To see why this is an incorrect explanation, imagine a bunch of gas molecules bouncing around inside a rigid container. They move at a constant speed until they run into another molecule or the walls of the container. In collisions, the molecules bounce off one another and off the walls like billiard balls. The molecules in a cool gas move slower, on average, than do molecules in a hot gas. This model is part of what is known as the kinetic theory of gases, and as a first approximation, it does a good job of explaining what gases do. Figure 1 shows a few gas molecules doing this."
