Swallowing or yawning may help to relieve the pressure Ear popping is caused by pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum. Air pressure in the middle ear usually is the same as the air pressure outside the body. Most people are familiar with the pressure changes (relieved by ear popping) that occur when you fly, travel to high altitudes, or dive underwater. Swallowing or yawning helps relieve the pressure by opening the Eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the back of the nose and upper throat. Opening the tube allows air to flow into or out of the middle ear and equalizes pressure on the eardrum. While annoying, this problem usually isnât serious."
