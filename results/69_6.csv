However, some side effects may continue after treatment is over because it takes time for healthy cells to recover from the effects of radiation therapy. Late side effects can occur months or years after treatment. If doses of radiation are high enough, some cells may not be able to repair themselves. As a result, some side effects may last a long time or be permanent. It is important to report side effects to the radiation therapy team. Many side effects can be relieved by medications, a change in diet or other measures."
