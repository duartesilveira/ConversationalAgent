This speciation phenomenon most commonly occurs through polyploidy, in which an offspring or group of offspring will be produced with twice the normal number of chromosomes.peciation can take place in two general ways. A single species may change over time into a new form that is different enough to be considered a new species. This process is known as anagenesis.

Many of these isolation events have been identified and are described as behavioral isolation, ecological isolation, and geographical isolation, to name a few.

The number of chromosomes must be constant in a specie. To maintain a constant number of chromosomes in species the gamete cells undergo meiosis. Meiosis is the reduction division because it reduces the number of chromosome. It only occurs in diploid cells and reduces the diploid cells (2n) to haploid cells (n) eg: gamete cells. Both gametes after meiosis will have half the number of chromosomes and when fusion occurs the original chromosome number is restored ensuring constant number of chromosomes in species.
