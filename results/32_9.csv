Some adaptations are structural. Structural adaptations are physical features of an organism like the bill on a bird or the fur on a bear.he size of the habitat depends on the organism s needs. A niche is the function that an organism performs in the food web of that community. A niche also includes everything else the organism does and needs in its environment. No two types of organisms occupy the exact same niche in a community.
