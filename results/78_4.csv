Itâs common to need to stay on your personalized version of the protocol for up to three years, but you donât need to stay on the full autoimmune protocol that long. Do 30-60 days elimination period. Then test out the reintroductions (this can take many months to complete).egin with full paleo for 3-6 months. This will be a big change already, and some people are lucky enough to go into remission with no further restrictions needed. If, after 3-6 months, you havenât seen the results you want, then transition to the autoimmune protocol."
