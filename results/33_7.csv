A well-written story usually causes us think about life, increasing our understanding of. the world, and giving us insight into how people think, feel and behave. The central insight into life. or human nature in a story is called the theme. The theme is the main idea in the story. The theme may be directly stated by the author of the story. When it is, we say the theme is explicit. Usually, however the reader must discover the theme through a careful reading of the story. When the theme must be inferred from the story we say the theme is implicit. Be careful not to confuse plot with theme. Plot is what happens in the story.
