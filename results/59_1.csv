When cut, the tendon acts like a rubber band, and the end pulls away from one another. When this happens it becomes impossible to bend your finger(s). If a tendon is partially cut, the finger may still bend a little. This usually painful and difficult. The finger nerves are close to the tendons, and a deep cut may injure them as well. This will cause numbness on one or both sides of affected finger. Sometimes, the flexor tendon may tear or pull away from the bone. In sports, a player may grab anotherâs jersey, the finger may get caught in the fabric causing the flexor tendon to tear. This injury is called a âjersey fingerâ."
