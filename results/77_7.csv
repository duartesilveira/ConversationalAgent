TOK Question #1 To what extent is truth different in mathematics, the arts, and ethics? In order to answer this question effectively, one must begin to identify what exactly the question implies. Because the question is asking the 'extent' that truth is different in mathematics, the arts, and ethics; one must examine how different and similar each area of knowledge is concerning the truth. 'Truth' can be defined as something with justification, so one must examine how justified elements are related in the areas of knowledge (AOKs)."

The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the body's own immune system attacks the body's joints."
