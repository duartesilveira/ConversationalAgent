First, intersectionality allows for feminist theorists to account for the differences between women. Although this may appear to be a simplistic observation, it has important implications for feminist theory and practice.n agreement, Tickner (2006) suggests that an integral element of feminist methodology is the awareness that theory cannot be separated from action.
