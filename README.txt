Project is composed of 4 notebooks that should be opened in the following order:

1. BertClassifier: Generates a pickle with the Logistic regression classifier with BERT embeddings
2. queryRewrite: Generates pickles with the re-written turns of every conversation for the 3 purposed methods
3. evaluate_Rewritting: Generates the results (BERT and LMD) for the raw queries and re-writen queries.
4. visualizeResults: Visualize the results obtained in the previous steps.

PS: The T5 algorithm will not work since it's missing the pre trained algorithm.
